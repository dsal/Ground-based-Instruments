Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) sensors are promising tools to monitor the energy budget and to control the heat and mass balance of the Arctic sea ice cover, as the surface reflectance of the sea ice is measured by HSI sensors. HSI sensors operate within a wavelength range and, depending on this range, reflectance is converted to broadband reflectance by retrieval algorithms. pectral resolution is an important characteristic of HSI, as the surface reflectance strongly depends on the wavelength. Also. incident and reflection angle controls the broadband reflectance of sea ice. Instrument characteristics and varying insolation caused by atmospheric particles and sky situations are two factors thatimpact HSI. In the NIR domain, the grain size of snow and ice plays a major role in the broadband reflectance and the BRDF of snow and sea ice is stronger in SWIR than in NIR.

The application of hyperspectral imaging has been widened in industry such as agriculture recently, and a variety of hyperspectral imaging sensors have been developed. Hyspex is a Norwegian brand for airborne and ground-based hyperspectral imaging. The spectral domain of Hyspex's cameras varies between 400-2500nm. Also, Specim is a Finnish company which offers a broadest range of hyperspectral cameras covering wavelengths from visible to thermal IR range. The specifications of Hyspex and Specim products as well as some companies are listed in the following table.
